//
// Four Pads - built from scratch per "How To Make A Noise" (Simon Cann)
// and "Synth Secrets" (Gordon Reid), plus current sound-design practice.
//
// Design brief (from research, not from the earlier Horizon Pad sketch):
//   - Cann's "main food groups": every sound is placed by its brightness
//     (very bright / bright / dull / very dull) and its attack speed
//     (fast-percussive / fast-non-percussive / medium / slow). Four pads
//     meant to blend by volume alone need to sit at four DIFFERENT points
//     on that grid, or stacking them just gets louder and muddier rather
//     than more interesting.
//   - Cann on richness/warmth: detuned oscillators + a sub-oscillator for
//     richness; slow attack/release + a second, even-slower-enveloped
//     oscillator for warmth and a sense of "changing tone" over time.
//   - Cann on layering: give each layer its OWN filter and envelope
//     (a "layered sound", not a "layered oscillator") so each can be
//     controlled and will age independently - this is what a modern
//     ambient-pad tutorial (MusicRadar) also lands on: separate amp/filter
//     envelopes per layer is what stops layers moving in lockstep.
//   - Synth Secrets on string machines: the classic analog ensemble sound
//     is detuned-oscillator-stack + a genuinely LFO-swept chorus, not a
//     fixed delay (a fixed delay is just a static comb filter and reads
//     as reedy/brassy - a mistake made and fixed earlier on this project).
//   - Vector synthesis (Prophet VS / Wavestation): the classic four-source
//     blend works because the four sources are chosen to be maximally
//     CONTRASTING, not four variations on the same idea.
//
// So the four pads below are deliberately spread across brightness and
// attack speed, and each owns its own oscillators/filter/envelope end to
// end - no shared signal path - so any combination you fade in blends
// rather than mudding up.
//
//   1) Warm Foundation - dull/warm, slow attack     - low-mid body
//   2) Analog Ensemble  - bright, medium attack      - mid/chorused
//   3) Airy Choir       - very bright, very slow     - high/air, long tail
//   4) Motion Pad       - medium, medium attack      - built-in movement
//
// Each has its own volume slider (v:Pads/...) so they blend purely by
// level, the way the user asked - no other interaction between them.

    // the very first instant regardless of the envelope. Now it starts
    // closed like Warm Foundation does and opens with the envelope, plus

//=========================================================================
// PAD 3: Airy Choir - very bright, very slow attack, high/air register
// with a long tail. Modelled on the "digital texture" layer in modern
// ambient-pad tutorials: a bandpass that sweeps up into the high end over
// a slow LFO, plus an octave-up shimmer send into its own reverb, so this
// pad occupies clear air above the other three rather than competing
// with them. All-oscillator source (no noise), per earlier feedback.
//=========================================================================
// Round 2 of taming: the entrance was fine but it kept swelling past the
// other pads (5s attack to a sustain of 0.7 means it's still growing long
// after everything else has settled) and both the release and the reverb
// tail ran too long. Fixed: much lower sustain level so it doesn't build
// into the dominant voice, release cut from 5s to 1.8s, reverb shortened
// and darkened further, sweep range and safety lowpass both dropped for
// more darkness, shimmer pulled back again.
// Round 3: overall evolution pulled in a lot (attack 5s -> 2.6s) so it
// lands with the other three pads instead of arriving noticeably later,
// but the sweep LFO is sped up a little so there's still clear ongoing
// movement within that shorter window rather than a static hold.
