/**
    The editor: one shared panel (HorizonScene - sky, glow, mountain ridge)
    behind a title banner, a preset row, an 8-column knob grid (PITCH, MOD,
    the four pad knobs, the macros grid, OUTPUT), and a footer strip - a
    pixel-accurate recreation of the Claude Design GUI handoff ("Horizon
    Pad.dc.html"), read directly rather than approximated. There is no
    on-screen keyboard: play from a MIDI keyboard/controller, matching a real
    Launchkey-style workflow (the eight knobs mirror a Launchkey 25's eight
    knobs, and the wheels mirror its pitch/mod wheels).

    The window size and every inset below (kTopBottomPadding etc.) are taken
    straight from the handoff's own CSS (panelStyle's padding, presetsRowStyle's
    margin-top, mainGridStyle's gap, ...), scaled 1:1 - not eyeballed.

    A fixed-size window: every child paints its own precise layout rather
    than scaling a "design surface", so there is no benefit to resizing and
    real risk of blurring the fine knob artwork.

    Motion. Everything moves because the sound changed, and only then:
      - the scene follows FILTER (time of day), REVERB (haze) and WIDTH
        (the glow's spread);
      - knobs glide after a preset recall or A/B switch, in a left-to-right
        wave, while a hand on a knob is followed at once (AnimatedKnob);
      - a recalled preset's name and description fade in under the wordmark;
      - each pad card glows with its layer's real output;
      - on open, the sky rises from night, the logo's sun comes up from
        behind its peaks and the knobs sweep up to their values.
    One frame callback (advanceFrame) drives it all, from the display's
    vertical blank while the editor is on screen, capped near 60 fps; each
    piece repaints only its own changed area, so a quiet editor costs
    nothing. It also replaces the old 15 Hz polling timer.
