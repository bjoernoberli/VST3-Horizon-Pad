/**
    Common machinery shared by the four Four Pads sound layers.

    Voice allocation happens once, centrally, in the processor: every layer is
    told about the same note in the same voice slot, so a chord plays coherently
    across all four layers. Each layer keeps its own oscillator state per voice
    and its own amplitude envelope with layer-specific, fixed (non-user-editable)
    ADSR timings taken straight from the validated Faust sound design
    (four_pads.dsp) - unlike an earlier iteration of this plugin, the current
    product spec exposes no per-layer tone knobs, only the four pad volumes and
    four global macros, so each layer's character is baked in rather than
    user-editable.

    Three global macros reach every layer identically, set once per block by
    the processor:
      * attackTimeScale     - ATTACK macro. 1.0 = the layer's own designed
                               attack time; <1 snappier, >1 slower. Multiplies
                               attack only, so each layer's relative timing
                               offset (part of what keeps the four pads from
                               all arriving at once) is preserved.
      * releaseTimeScale    - RELEASE macro. 1.0 = the layer's own designed
                               release time; <1 shorter, >1 longer. Multiplies
                               release only, the same way attackTimeScale
                               multiplies attack.
      * brightness           - FILTER macro, ramped per sample (smoothedBrightness,
                               not stepped once per block like the other two
                               above) since it feeds a filter cutoff directly
                               and a block-rate step there is audible as
                               zipper noise. 1.0 = the layer's own designed
                               cutoff curve; <1 darker, >1 brighter. Multiplies
                               whatever cutoff-over-time curve the layer already
                               computes from its envelope, rather than replacing
                               it, so the "opens with the envelope" shape from
                               the sound design survives at every macro setting.
                               Read live per voice per sample via
                               effectiveBrightness(), which uses this shared
                               ramp unless that voice was frozen by
                               freezeBrightnessForActiveVoices() - see its doc
                               comment for why.

    Stereo width comes from one WIDTH macro shared by all four layers. Each
    layer turns it into its own width through a fixed profile
    (widthProfile(): where on the knob the layer starts to open, and how wide
    it gets), so the shape across the pads changes as the knob turns - the
    air opens first, the foundation last and least. Until 2026-10-02 there
    was a WIDTH knob per pad, and every factory preset set all four to the
    same value. Since sound-design v2 (2026-09-26) the width itself is built by spreading
    each voice's detuned oscillators across the stereo field (panGains()),
    not by a Haas delay tap on the summed layer. Detuned oscillators are
    decorrelated, so the spread is mono-safe by construction - no comb
    filter, no null - and constant-power panning keeps the level flat from
    WIDTH 0 to 1. The old Haas tap measured a comb in mono and a ~1.5 dB
    level drop at full width (docs/dsp-review-2026-09-26.md, S-3). WIDTH 0
    reproduces the old mono sound exactly: every pan gain is 1.

    DETUNE (2026-10-02) scales every layer's unison spread: the static detune
    of each stack oscillator and its baseline drift - and on Clearing, Expanse
    and Bloom the drift is most of the spread (static detune 0.3-1.6 cents,
    drift about +/-7). The multiplier runs 0.5x..2x on the macroMultiplier
    curve, so 50% is the designed sound, bit-exact. It eases out below C3
    (makeDetuneRamp(), the same register blend as unisonFor()), so the bass
    tightening keeps low notes stable whatever DETUNE does. It leaves alone
    what is not a unison partner: Root's saw edge and sub-octave, and the
    extra drift the MOD wheel adds on top (driftDepth()).

    Performance state (pitch bend, mod wheel) also reaches every layer
    identically, set once per block:
      * pitchBendSemitones  - added to every voice's frequency this block.
      * modAmount            - extra analog-style drift depth on top of each
                               layer's own baseline drift, 0 = baseline only.

    Rendering is done into a per-layer scratch buffer so that each layer can
    apply its own filtering/effects independently before being summed into the
    mix by the processor.

    Everything here is allocation-free once prepare() has run. prepare() is the
    only method that may allocate and is only ever called from prepareToPlay().

        Starts `midiNote` in this slot, declicking the handover if the slot is

        Taking over a slot used to be a hard reset of the envelope and the
        oscillator phases mid-cycle. Measured with HorizonPadSoundTool
        (`--note-onsets` to force a steal, `--probe-at` on the steal instant),
        that step was -2..-11 dB relative to the signal, against -18..-23 dB
        for a note-on into a free slot: an audible click, and easy to provoke
        with a sustain pedal and more than kMaxVoices notes held.

        So a sounding slot is ramped to zero over kStealFadeSeconds first and
        the incoming note is started once the ramp lands - at the next block
        boundary after it completes, which is at most one block late. That is
        well under the ~2 ms onset JND for every attack this instrument can
