/**
    PAD 3 / EXPANSE - Airy Choir: very bright, very slow attack, high/air
    register with a long tail.

    Direct C++ port of "airyChoir" in four_pads.dsp: a three-oscillator detuned
    triangle stack an octave up, through a resonant bandpass that sweeps slowly
    into the top end, plus an octave-up "shimmer" send (highpass -> pitch shift
    -> reverb) so this pad occupies clear air above the other three. All
    oscillator-based, no noise source, per the sound design's own history (an
    earlier noise-based texture layer was replaced for reading as unwanted hiss).

    The shimmer's pitch shift and reverb are shared per LAYER rather than
    computed per voice (each voice still gets its own bandpass sweep and its
    own envelope): the Faust source's envelope is applied to the *combined*
    swept+shimmer signal, not before, so per-voice contributions can be summed
    into one shimmer bus and processed once - both truer to the original
    signal-flow order and far cheaper than a pitch-shifter and reverb per voice.

    Sound-design v2 (2026-09-26):
      * The sweep and the safety lowpass track the note, anchored at C4 where
        the sweep was voiced. Fixed in Hz, the layer measured -43 LUFS at C2,
        -29 at C4 and -55 at C7 - a 27 dB span, most of it the bandpass
        missing the oscillators entirely away from C4.
      * The safety lowpass is one pole, as in the prototype
        (`fi.lowpass(1, 1800)`). The port had a two-pole SVF there: -17 dB at
        5-10 kHz against the prototype, the largest real divergence G5 found.
      * Triangles are polyBLAMP-corrected (EX-003: this layer runs an octave
        up and aliased at MIDI 96-108).
      * Oscillators are spread by WIDTH, and the shimmer reverb runs in
        stereo with its width following the layer's WIDTH, so the shimmer is
        the widest thing in the instrument instead of a mono tail.
      * Register pinning. This layer is "clear air above the other three".
        Played at C3 its octave-up stack sat at 262 Hz, at C2 at 131 Hz - in
        the other layers' band, and measured +6.8 dB in 200-500 Hz at the
        reference chord once key tracking stopped filtering it away. Below C4
        the stack now stays near the octave it was voiced in (C5), following
        the note's pitch class and crossfading between the two nearest
        octaves - the way an organ's mixture ranks "break back" to stay in
        the ear's bright register however low the note. Same pitch class,
        same harmony; at C4 and above nothing changes.
