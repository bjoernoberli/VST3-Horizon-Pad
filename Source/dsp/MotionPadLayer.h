/**
    PAD 4 / BLOOM - Motion Pad: medium brightness, medium attack, built-in
    movement.

    Port of "motionPad" in four_pads.dsp: a two-oscillator detuned sawtooth
    stack through a slow-sweeping lowpass, with audible tremolo on top. The
    odd one out on purpose - where the other three pads sustain and swell,
    this one keeps moving throughout the note, so it reads as
    "motion/interest" rather than another sustain layer.

    Since sound-design v2 (2026-09-26) the tremolo and the filter LFO are
    shared by every voice of the layer. Per-voice LFOs with random phases
    averaged the pulse away in chords: 3.2 Hz tremolo depth measured 44% on
    one note and 16% on a four-note chord (review S-5), and a pad is played
    in chords. One shared pulse keeps the designed depth at any voicing; the
    shared phase is still random per instance, so two instances do not lock.
