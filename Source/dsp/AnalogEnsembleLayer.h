/**
    PAD 2 / CLEARING - Analog Ensemble: bright, medium attack, chorused mid
    register.

    Port of "analogEnsemble" in four_pads.dsp: a three-oscillator detuned
    sawtooth stack, a lowpass that starts closed and opens with the envelope
    (like every other pad, so this layer doesn't sound "ahead" of the others at
    note-on regardless of the ATTACK macro setting), then an ensemble.

    The ensemble, since sound-design v2 (2026-09-26). The prototype used one
    delay line per voice swept 2-11 ms at 0.11 Hz - a slow mono flanger. Its
    own design notes cite Synth Secrets on string machines, and the string
    machine's ensemble is something else: several short delay lines on the
    summed output, each modulated by a slow and a fast LFO at 120 degree
    phase offsets, left and right taken at different phases. Three taps
    whose modulations sum to zero keep the average delay steady while each
    tap's pitch wavers - thickness without a wobble - and the offset between
    the channels makes it genuinely stereo. That is what this layer now uses,
    on the layer bus (after the per-voice lowpass, as on a Solina), with a
    slow common drift at the prototype's 0.11 Hz so the comb notches still
    move the way the signed-off sound's did. A *fixed* delay is still the
    thing to avoid: it is a static comb filter and reads reedy/brassy, a
    mistake caught during the Faust sound design.

    Delay reads use 4-point Hermite interpolation (rule 10) and every length
    is a time converted at prepare() (rule 21).
