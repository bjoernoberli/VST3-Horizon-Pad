# Tier P gate status

One page: where Horizon Pad stands against the playbook's gates (v3.2: core card
section 2, F.15.1). Last updated **2026-10-03**.

Tier **P** (Product), promoted from S on 2026-09-22, which means re-entering at
G0 and doing every gate the project skipped as a sketch.

| Gate | Status | Artefact |

## G6 in detail

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Steinberg validator exit 0 | **PASS** - 47/47, 2026-09-24 (v1). Re-run on v2 (`5056369`) 2026-10-03: **47/47**, VST3 SDK 3.8.1 (`3cdf9ca`) |
| pluginval strictness 10 | **PASS** - 2026-09-24 (v1). Re-run on v2 2026-10-03: **PASS**, pluginval 1.0.4, in-process (1.0.4 has no `--rtcheck`) |
| CTest suite green | **PASS** - 8/8 (v1, 2026-09-24); **19/19 in 55 s** on v2, 2026-10-03 |
| Real-time safety (rule 35) | **PASS** on v2, 2026-10-03: all 19 tests clean under RealtimeSanitizer (`build-rtsan`, see CLAUDE.md); self-test proves the check fires |
| Three hosts, two platforms | **1 of 3.** Ableton Live on macOS confirmed by the owner. Windows Ableton and Waveform outstanding. |

The tests are in `tools/tests/dsp_tests.py`, registered with CTest by
`CMakeLists.txt`: definition-of-done properties (latency, seeded determinism, the
36-combination rate/block matrix, 60 s of silence, all presets safe), regression
guards (one per bug measurement caught), presence tests per defining feature, and
instrument-level contracts (keyboard span, mono bass, pedal, low register, width).

## What is outstanding

In rough order of how much each would change (revised 2026-10-03):

1. **Three hosts, two platforms** (G6). Windows Ableton and Waveform, now on the v2
   build. The only hard gate still open.
2. ~~Owner decision: stereo bass from the reverb~~ - **fixed 2026-10-03** (owner
   approved): the side high-pass moved to the end of `FxChain`, after the reverb
   return. `bass_is_mono` gained a REVERB 100% case (failed at -5.3 dB on the old
   build, passes now); dry path nulls at -147 dBFS at REVERB 0; loudness -0.05 to
   -0.15 LU. Listening item: the reverb's low end on Sternenzelt, Bergecho and
   Steinerne Ruhe - the high-pass's phase shift also raised their occasional peaks
   by up to 1.5 dB (output still >= 4 dB under 0 dBTP).
3. **The listening pass** - see below; the Sternenzelt items were heard 2026-10-03.
4. **CPU on the target machine** (G3) - and as worst-case block time (rule 37), not
   the 5.03% average measured on an M3 Pro. Take it during the Windows pass.
5. **Rule audits not yet done**: event timing (29 - `LayerBase::startNote`'s comment
   says a stolen note starting up to one block late is "well under the ~2 ms onset
   JND"; at 512 samples that is 10.7 ms), control mappings and note hygiene (30), the
   output limiter and `tanh` as nonlinear models (33).
6. **FILTER response error at 44.1 vs 96 kHz** (G3). Not measured as a swept
   response; mitigated structurally by every filter being TPT/ZDF.
7. **CI**: pluginval, the RTSan job and a pinned VST3 SDK commit are not in
   `build.yml` yet (playbook D.4). Automation *during* playback and state loads
   mid-stream are not yet covered by any RTSan-checked test.

## The listening pass, in one place

**How to run it (one blind session closes the whole list).** Compare v1 - `bf17ee8`,
the signed-off sound before sound-design v2 - with the current `main`, which carries
v2, the WIDTH/DETUNE macros and the reverb bass fix. One comparison answers every
item below, because the changes are cumulative:

```bash
git worktree add --detach ../hp-v1 bf17ee8
cmake -S ../hp-v1 -B ../hp-v1/build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_JUCE="$PWD/build-release/_deps/juce-src"
cmake --build ../hp-v1/build --target HorizonPadSoundTool
cmake --build build-release --target HorizonPadSoundTool
python3 tools/listening/make_session.py --baseline ../hp-v1/build/HorizonPadSoundTool \
        --candidate build-release/HorizonPadSoundTool --out build-listening
open build-listening/index.html
```

19 items, each loudness-matched to -20 LUFS, "1"/"2"/X randomised per item; export the
verdicts as JSON at the end and add them here. `expanse_top` is not truly blind: v1's
Expanse was nearly silent at C7 (+32 dB to match), so judge only whether the current
one is clean. The GUI item (37 px macro knobs) is judged in the plugin itself.

These are the items that measurement has taken as far as it can. Each is a
character decision.

| From | Item |
|---|---|
| EX-001 | The 2 Hz DC blocker's effect on the lowest octave (-0.09 dB at 13.75 Hz, calculated not heard) |
| EX-002 | ~~Whether to rebalance Sternenzelt into the loudness match~~ - **heard 2026-10-03, owner: "Sternenzelt is ok as is"**; no rebalance |
| EX-003 | Whether Expanse's alias at MIDI 96-108 is audible at all |
| G5 | The shimmer now actually transposes - Expanse is substantially brighter than the shipped sound |
| G5 | Filter Q values sit below the prototype's Butterworth; Expanse's safety lowpass is 2-pole where the prototype's is 1-pole |
| G5 | Shimmer blend sits 16 dB below the prototype |
| G1 #4/#5 | Linear interpolation on the flanger and shimmer grain reads, where the rule wants Lagrange/Hermite |

Reference material for the A/B is committed: `sound design/reference-renders/`
holds the four per-layer renders and the full blend the sound design was
signed off on.

## Exceptions on the books

| ID | Subject | Status |
|---|---|---|
| EX-001 | DC offset when the output limiter engages | CLOSED 2026-09-23 - fixed, marginal pass |
| EX-002 | Sternenzelt ~4.8 LU below the matched bank | OPEN - accepted; confirmed by ear 2026-10-03 |
| EX-003 | Expanse aliases at MIDI 96-108 | OPEN - accepted |

## Sound-design v2 (branch `sound-design-v2`, 2026-09-26)

A second review found the gates green while the design itself had drifted, and
that a harness bug had invalidated the G5 numbers (corrected in
[`g5-null-test.md`](g5-null-test.md)). Findings:
[`dsp-review-2026-09-26.md`](dsp-review-2026-09-26.md); changes and measurements:
[`sound-design-v2.md`](sound-design-v2.md). On the branch, not merged:

- **G3/G5 reopen for v2** - measured against v1 with `tools/measure/descriptors.py`
  and `register.py` (baselines in `docs/baselines/`), 17/17 tests. The v2 sound
  deliberately diverges from the Faust prototype, which stays the frozen v1 reference.
- **G6 on v2** - Steinberg validator 47/47 and pluginval L10 re-run 2026-10-03
  (see G6 above); hosts still owed.
- **Listening debt** - ten items, listed in `sound-design-v2.md`, with a blind,
  loudness-matched A/B page generated by `tools/listening/make_session.py`.

## WIDTH and DETUNE macros (branch `sound-design-v2`, 2026-10-02)

Owner decisions in [`brief.md`](brief.md) A-006; design and measurements in
[`width-design-draft.md`](width-design-draft.md). Four per-pad WIDTH knobs became
one WIDTH macro with a fixed profile per pad, and DETUNE was added: ten host
parameters, 19/19 tests (two new, each shown failing with its feature disabled).
WIDTH 0 with DETUNE 50% nulls bit-exact against `05c3f44`; presets moved -0.01
to +0.29 LU. Baseline: `docs/baselines/descriptors-v2-macros.json`.

Listening debt added (items in `tools/listening/make_session.py`, baseline a
worktree of `05c3f44`):

| Item | Question |
|---|---|
| `preset_klarheit`, `preset_lagerfeuer` | The staggered WIDTH profile against the same width on all four pads: clearer, or just narrower? |
| ~~`preset_sternenzelt`~~ | Heard 2026-10-03, owner: "Sternenzelt is ok as is" |
| `root_chord` | Root at full WIDTH is now 60% of its spread: still enough stereo? |
| `detune_tight` | DETUNE 0%: tighter and cleaner, or static? |
| `detune_wide` | DETUNE 100%: lush, or seasick? Clearing responds least (its ensemble dominates its spread) - audible enough there? |
| GUI | Six macros in the MACROS card: 37 px knobs where the design had 42 px - still comfortable to grab? |

## 2026-10-03 - flaky test fixed, G6 re-run, real-time safety, translation battery

- **`voice_steal_declick` was flaky, not regressed.** It took the worst of six
  *unseeded* renders per side and failed about 2 runs in 10. Over seeds 1-30 the
  current build and `05c3f44` are indistinguishable (same three seeds high), so the
  WIDTH/DETUNE change did not cause it. Now seeded over twelve fixed seeds, comparing
  medians and worst cases; shown failing on a build with the declick removed
  (median steal -9.6 dB vs free -17.5 dB) and passing on HEAD.
- **G6 re-run on v2**: Steinberg validator 47/47 (SDK 3.8.1), pluginval L10 pass.
- **Rule 35**: `HORIZON_RTSAN` builds the sound tool with RealtimeSanitizer; all 19
  tests pass clean; `HORIZON_RTSAN_SELFTEST=1` aborts as it must.
- **Rule 34, translation battery** (`tools/measure/translation.py`, baseline
  `docs/baselines/translation-v2.json`, 18 presets x 3 seeds): mono sums lose -0.3 to
  -2.3 LU with no comb (worst band -4.4 dB); phone-speaker loss -0.4 to -3.0 LU, no
  outlier against the bank; PLR 11.1-12.9 dB, so normalised to -14 LUFS the peaks
  reach -0.9 to -2.4 dBTP (Bergecho -0.9 and Morgentau -1.0 brush AES TD1008's -1 dBTP,
  which only matters if someone raises the pad 4 dB with no limiter); AAC and MP3 at
  128 kbit/s decode at or below -1.0 dBTP with tail residuals near -30 dB. Failed
  only on stereo bass from the reverb - fixed the same day (item 2); after the fix
  every preset passes.
- **Battery redesign, disclosed:** the first version also failed presets whose true
  peak would exceed -1 dBTP if turned up to -14 LUFS with no limiter (after the fix:
  Sternenzelt and Steinerne Ruhe +0.4 dBTP). No delivery chain does that; AES TD1008's
  -1 dBTP applies to a mastered file before encoding. The codec row now masters each
  render to -1 dBTP and measures the decode (AAC overshoot <= 0.1 dB, MP3 no clipped
  samples), and the -14 LUFS peak is reported, not judged. PLR 11.4-13.6 dB.

## Checked against two practitioner videos (2026-10-04) - proposals for the owner

Sage Audio, "Fixing the 3 WORST Sounds in Modern Music Production" and "Formant
Shifting is WAY More Useful Than People Think" (transcripts read; integrated into the
playbook as v3.3: I.1, I.5.1, I.7.1, E.2-E.4, E.8.6-E.10). What they mean for Horizon Pad:

**Measured: Horizon Pad is not "sterile".** The first video's complaint about stock
synths is identical repeats - same tuning, timing and decay every time. The same
four-note chord struck three times (product mode, unseeded) differs strike to strike
by a +3.0 dB residual (uncorrelated waveforms: random start phases and drift), up to
6.3 dB in 100 ms envelope windows and 640 cents in brightness, while the mean level
holds within 0.09 dB - which is what a pad should keep. Nothing to fix; the
measurement (`dspkit.repeat_variation`) is the playbook's new A.6 descriptor.

**Proposals - each changes the signed-off sound, so none is applied:**

| # | Idea | From | What it would change | How to judge it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | ~~**Expanse as a choir with fixed formants.**~~ **Declined by the owner, 2026-10-04: "leave as is - it adds more movement across the register, I like it."** The key-tracked resonance stays. Expanse is called a choir but has no vowel formants: its one resonant band-pass tracks the note (0.7 above C4, 0.3 below), so its resonance - its apparent size - moves with every note. Real voices keep their formants fixed while the pitch moves. A small fixed vowel-formant bank (not key-tracked) after the stack would keep one "singer" across the keyboard | Formants video | Expanse's character across the range | Spectral-envelope peak vs note (flat = one singer); keyboard span test; blind A/B against `05c3f44`/HEAD |
| P2 | **Voice-card variance.** Small fixed per-voice-slot offsets (cutoff, envelope time, tuning) so a chord's notes are never quite identical - what analog polysynths do and their reissues expose as "vintage" | Playbook I.5.1, prompted by the stock-synth fix | Chord texture, very subtly | Chord-note variance; must stay inside level and tuning JNDs |
| P3 | **A quiet delay** in the FX chain to fill the gaps between chord changes, its feedback carrying the drift | Stock-synth fix, step 4 | Adds an effect; needs a macro or a fixed amount - brief amendment (editing stays shallow) | Gap energy between chords; mix-context listening |
| P4 | **Tape-style softening** (gentle HF roll-off, slight wow/flutter) on the output | Stock-synth fix, step 2 | The top end and stability of everything | Centroid and modulation spectrum; blind A/B |
| P5 | **Early reflections before the Freeverb tail** for a believable room (the current send has 20 ms pre-delay, deliberately, and a late-tail-weighted algorithm) | "Realistic room first" | The reverb's front | Impulse response energy in 5-80 ms; listening |

Not applicable: formant de-essing, kick weight, noise-carrier air and vocal thickening
are mixing uses on recorded sources; Horizon Pad has no voice or drum input.
