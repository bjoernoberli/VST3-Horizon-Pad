G3 metric battery for Horizon Pad.

Runs the measurements docs/brief.md's `quality_targets` asks for and prints a
markdown table. Everything here drives the real plugin DSP through
HorizonPadSoundTool, seeded so runs are reproducible.

Not covered here: the alias floor (tools/measure/alias_check.py - it needs a
two-sample-rate comparison) and the null test (tools/measure/null_test.py).

    the audible envelope rises faster than the amplitude ramp (the filter is
    opening at the same time, adding harmonics) and falls further than the
    sustain level (the filter closes again). juce::ADSR gets the designed
    values unmodified - see LayerBase::beginNote() - so what is measured here
